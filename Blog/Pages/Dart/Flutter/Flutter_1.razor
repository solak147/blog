<h3><b>解決方式</b></h3>
<p>
    發生這種情況是因為您項目中的 gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties 的 gdistributionUrl 版本為 gradle 7 以上 <br />
    1.降級你的 gradle 版本( 小於 7 )  <br />
    2.到flutter sdk 資料夾下，按照<MudLink Href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/79167/files" Underline="Underline.Always">此方式</MudLink>進行更改。  <br />
